# Bitwise AND

The bitwise AND & operator returns 1 if and only if both the operands are 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.

The following table demonstrates the working of the bitwise AND operator. Let a and b be two operands that can only take binary values i.e. 1 and 0.

a	b	a & b
0	0	0  --- false
0	1	0  --- false
1	0	0  --- false
1	1	1  --- true
Let's take a look at the bitwise AND operation of two integers 12 and 25.

12 = 00001100 (In Binary)
25 = 00011001 (In Binary)

// Bitwise AND Operation of 12 and 25
   00001100
 & 00011001
____________
   00001000 = 8 (In Decimal)
